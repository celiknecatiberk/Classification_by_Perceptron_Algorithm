# Classification_by_Perceptron_Algorithm
This is Matlab code for Machine Learning

It is a project developed on the use of Perceptron algorithm, one of the machine learning algorithms, over Matlab. Perceptron was trained using ready dataset. Various activation functions of Perceptron have been used. These functions are;

1-) Step Function
2-) Sign Function
3-) Sigmoid Function
4-) Linear Function
